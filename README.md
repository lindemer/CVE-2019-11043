# CVE-2019-11043
PHP-FPM Remote Code Execution

Screencast: [https://youtu.be/d6benC5FVZM](https://youtu.be/d6benC5FVZM)

## Overview
This zero-day exploit in common PHP-FPM configurations was discovered during the _Realworld CTF_ competition in 2019. A regular expression is used to parse the requested URI, but newline characters `%0a` are not matched. This triggers a bug in FastCGI which computes the query string length incorrectly and writes a null byte to a location _before_ the start of the intended buffer. By careful selection of the query string length, an attacker can use this bug to overwrite internal PHP variables on the server and execute arbitrary shell code.

The original Go implementation of this exploit can be found in [here](https://github.com/neex/phuip-fpizdam). I have used this and other explanations of the vulnerability as learning resources in order to implement the exploit in Python.

## Instructions

**Docker on Linux** Run `sudo docker run --rm -ti -p 8080:80 reproduce-cve-2019-11043` to instantiate a barebone NGINX/PHP-FPM server with an empty script at `/script.php`. The Dockerfile for this image is available [here](https://github.com/neex/phuip-fpizdam), though it is not needed to run the aforementioned command. 

**Docker on Mac** Run `sudo docker-compuse up -d` from the `/php/CVE-2019-11043` directory of the [vulhub](https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub) repository. (Compose is included with Docker for Mac.)

Run the exploit script with the command `python3 exploit.py http://localhost:8080/script.php` (or `/index.php` if the second option was used). Upon successful execution, a Web shell will be accessible by appending commands to the URL after `?a=` (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/script.php?a=uname -a`).

*N.B. I did attempt to create an Ansible playbook for this assignment, but I came up against a show-stopping bug documented [here](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/71528). It is not possible to start systemd services on recent Linux kernels (e.g., any Ubuntu LTS release) with an Ansible playbook.*

## Theory

#### Vulnerability
PHP-FPM configuration files contain a rule for matching incoming URI requests to PHP scripts which often look like this:
```
location ~ [^/]\.php(/|$) {
  ...
  fastcgi_split_path_info       ^(.+?\.php)(/.*)$;
  fastcgi_param PATH_INFO       $fastcgi_path_info;
  fastcgi_pass                  php:9000;
  ...
}
```
This _should_ match any URI in the form `/script.php/info`, but `.` actually doesn't match new line `%0a` characters. If the URI contains a new line, it will trigger the following [bug](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/php-7.3.10/sapi/fpm/fpm/fpm_main.c#L1151) in the PHP implementation:
```
1141    int ptlen = strlen(pt);
1142    int slen = len - ptlen;
1143    int pilen = env_path_info ? strlen(env_path_info) : 0;
1144    int tflag = 0;
1145    char *path_info;
1146    if (apache_was_here) {
1147        /* recall that PATH_INFO won't exist */
1148        path_info = script_path_translated + ptlen;
1149        tflag = (slen != 0 && (!orig_path_info || strcmp(orig_path_info, path_info) != 0));
1150    } else {
1151        path_info = env_path_info ? env_path_info + pilen - slen : NULL;
1152        tflag = (orig_path_info != path_info);
1153    }
```
