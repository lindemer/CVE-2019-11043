# CVE-2019-11043
PHP-FPM Remote Code Execution

## Overview
This zero-day exploit in common PHP-FPM configurations was discovered during the _Realworld CTF_ competition in 2019. The vulnerability stems from a bug in FastCGI's regex parser implementation. The server expects URIs in the form `GET /script.php/path_info`, but newline characters `%0a` are not properly handled, allowing a carefully-constructed input to overwrite internal FastCGI configuration variables.

A complete Go implementation of this exploit can be found as a submodule in this repository. I have used this and other explanations of the vulnerability as learning resources to partially re-implement the exploit in Python.
